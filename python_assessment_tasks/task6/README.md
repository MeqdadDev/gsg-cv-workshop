# Task 6
Task6 for technical assessment in Python proficiency in the Computer Vision Workshop with Gaza Sky Geeks.

### Task 6: (Linear Algebra)

Given a set of linear equations in matrix form Ax=b, implement a function to find the solution vector x. (Hint: you may need the functions you wrote in Task 5).

Use that function to solve the following system of equations (after writing them in the matrix form):

```
x + 2y + 3z = 10
2x + 5y + 3z = 15
2x + 8z = 20
```
